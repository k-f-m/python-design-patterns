# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Abstract Factory enables us to create objects that follow a general pattern, but with specific implementations that can vary depending on their context of use.

Real-world examples where the Abstract Factory pattern can be used:

- Abstract Factory provides a way for a GUI toolkit to create a family of user experience-specific components.
- A game could use an Abstract Factory to create different types of enemies.
- A database driver could use an Abstract Factory to create different types of connections
