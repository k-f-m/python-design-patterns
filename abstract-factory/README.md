# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Real-world examples where the Abstract Factory pattern can be used in Python:

- Creating a GUI factory that can create buttons and checkboxes for different platforms (Windows, Mac)
- Creating a database abstraction layer that can work with different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Creating a game that can run on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
